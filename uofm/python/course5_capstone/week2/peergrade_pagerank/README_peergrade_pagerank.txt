Welcome Hieu Dai Trinh from Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python

Page Rank
First you will spider 100 pages from http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/ run the
page rank algorithm and take some screen shots. Then you will reset the spider
process and spider 100 pages from any other site on the Internet, run the page
rank algorithm, and take some screen shots.

Don't take off points for little mistakes. If they seem to have done the
assignment give them full credit. Feel free to make suggestions if there are
small mistakes. Please keep your comments positive and useful. The course
staff will assign the last 30% of the grade and it may take a few days to get
graded.
